I'm a **big** open-source fan. Therefore, I open-source as much of my code as I
can, you can view my [GitHub](https://github.com/nloomans) and my
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nloomans) profile. Most of my work are websites,
and I really enjoy making them, here are some of my favorites:

<div class="projects">
  <a class="project" href="http://rooster.hetmml.nl" target="_black" rel="noopener">
    <img src="/assets/projects/rooster.hetmml.nl.png" alt="rooster.hetmml.nl homepage">
    <header>Metis Rooster</header>
  </a>
  <a class="project" href="http://managerzonderstress.nl" target="_black" rel="noopener">
    <img src="/assets/projects/managerzonderstress.nl.png" alt="managerzonderstress.nl homepage">
    <header>Manager zonder stress</header>
  </a>
</div>

The first one, Metis Rooster, is one I wrote for my school. It’s an improved
schedule page. The problem with the old one was that’s it’s incredibly
difficult to select your own schedule on mobile. You had to find your own
student id out of a list containing a virtually infinite amount of student ids,
in random order.

Compare that to this version where you simply type your student id in a search
box.

The second on, Manager wonder stress, is a website I made for my father. And
while I personally don’t like how it came out, I did get some valuable
experience of working with a boss.
